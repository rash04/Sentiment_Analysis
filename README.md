This repository includes three python files. Please note that by changing the value of the variable "dataset" to either "yelp" or "imdb", the same code can be used on a different dataset.

* **Feature Engineering:** code for setting up the dataset so that in can be used as an input to various ML models

* **Binary Bag of Words:** code for creating a binary bag of words from scratch, and running the Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and SVM models on it. Key Performance metrics are recorded and compared.

* **Frequency Bag of Words:** code for creating a frequency bag of words from scratch, and running the Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and SVM models on it. Key Performance metrics are recorded and compared.

See the Question.pdf and Report.pdf files for more details and analysis.
